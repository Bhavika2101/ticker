ROOST_METHOD_HASH=addHoldingToHoldingSummary_d560508468
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addHoldingToHoldingSummary_906dbd0500

The function `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` takes three parameters: `holdingSummary` of type `HoldingSummary`, `holding` of type `c.Holding`, and `currencyRateByUse` of type `currency.CurrencyRateByUse`. Additionally, the function returns a `HoldingSummary`. There's also a conditional check that if the `holding.Cost` or `holding.Value` is `0`, it simply returns the `holdingSummary` without modification.

Here are the testing scenarios for the `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` function:

---

Scenario 1: Adding a valid holding to the summary

Details:
  TestName: TestAddHoldingWithValidInput
  Description: Testing the addHoldingToHoldingSummary function with a valid holding and checking if the holding is added to the holding summary correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HoldingSummary object and a c.Holding object with non-zero cost and value. Also, create a currency.CurrencyRateByUse object.
  Act: Call addHoldingToHoldingSummary with the prepared objects.
  Assert: Check that the HoldingSummary returned by the function reflects the addition of the holding, by asserting the changes in value, cost, and changes fields.
Validation:
  Justify: Since the holding has a non-zero cost and value, it is expected to contribute to the summary without any errors.
  Importance: Itâ€™s important to ensure that valid data is processed correctly, as this will be a common scenario in application usage.

---

Scenario 2: Holding with zero cost and value

Details:
  TestName: TestAddHoldingWithZeroCostAndValue
  Description: Ensure the addHoldingToHoldingSummary function does not modify the summary if the holding has a zero cost and value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HoldingSummary object and a c.Holding object with zero cost and value. Another object for the currency conversion is also initialized.
  Act: Call addHoldingToHoldingSummary with these objects.
  Assert: Check that the HoldingSummary returned is the same as the one inputted, by asserting no changes in any of its attributes.
Validation:
  Justify: The function is expected to return the input summary unchanged if the holding is not valid (cost and value are zero).
  Importance: This prevents invalid data from affecting the summary, which is a crucial aspect of reliable financial calculations.

Based on the extracted function, these scenarios cover the regular operation and edge cases. Error handling scenarios are not defined here as the code doesn't throw errors but follows a guard clause pattern to prevent unwanted behavior. If there were explicit error cases, we would formulate tests for those too, ensuring complete coverage of the function's behavior.

ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addHoldingToHoldingSummary_906dbd0500

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: If the currencyRateByUse fields are large enough, the multiplications with the holding.Value and holding.Cost could lead to a float64 overflow, resulting in incorrect calculations or a denial of service.
Solution: Validate or cap the range of inputs for currency rates and holding values to ensure that their multiplications stay within the bounds of float64.

Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide By Zero
Issue: If the 'cost' or 'value' variable is 0, the division operations to calculate totalChangePercent and dayChangePercent could result in a runtime panic due to divide-by-zero.
Solution: Include checks to ensure cost and value are not zero before performing division operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: There is a risk of overflow in the assignments of 'dayChange' and 'totalChange' if the input holding values are not validated, which could also lead to incorrect financial calculations.
Solution: Implement checks on the value of the inputs and perform appropriate error handling if the input is beyond expected thresholds.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function does not handle cases where currencyRateByUse may contain abnormal or exceptional values, which can result in incorrect holding calculations.
Solution: Perform a thorough validation on the currencyRateByUse object to ensure that all contained values are within expected ranges before using them in calculations.

================================================================================
The function `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` is indeed present in the `asset.go` file, which is part of the `asset` package. To craft accurate test scenarios, if not all of the function definition is visible, the tests will be based on the following assumptions derived from the code segment and additional statements within the `asset.go` file:

- `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` likely takes a `HoldingSummary` structure, a `Holding` structure, and a `currency.CurrencyRateByUse` structure as arguments.
- The `HoldingSummary` type contains fields like `Value`, `Cost`, `TotalChange`, and `DayChange`, where `DayChange` and `TotalChange` are of type `c.HoldingChange`.
- The `c` package alias seems to refer to `github.com/achannarasappa/ticker/internal/common`, which we can speculate contains further type definitions like `HoldingChange`.
- There is a mention of weighing assets based on the holding summary value, indicating that the function might calculate the weight of holdings.

Given this information, the following test scenarios can be crafted:

```
Scenario 1: Successfully adding a holding to an empty holding summary

Details:
  TestName: TestAddHoldingToEmptyHoldingSummary
  Description: This test verifies the addHoldingToHoldingSummary function when adding a holding to a previously empty holding summary. The expected behavior is that the holding's value and cost will initialize the summary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate an empty HoldingSummary struct and a Holding struct with predetermined value and cost.
  Act: Call addHoldingToHoldingSummary with these structs.
  Assert: Use Go's assert.Equal to verify that the HoldingSummary reflects the values of the Holding used in the operation.
Validation:
  Justify: Since the holding summary is initially empty, its final value and cost should match exactly the values of the added holding.
  Importance: This test ensures that the initial state of the holding summary is correctly updated when the first holding is added.

Scenario 2: Adding a holding to a non-empty holding summary

Details:
  TestName: TestAddHoldingToNonEmptyHoldingSummary
  Description: This test examines the addHoldingToHoldingSummary function when adding a holding to a non-empty holding summary. It targets the cumulative addition of value and cost.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a HoldingSummary with some existing values, and a Holding with known value and cost.
  Act: Invoke addHoldingToHoldingSummary to add the Holding to the HoldingSummary.
  Assert: Assert that the new value and cost in HoldingSummary are the sum of the original and the Holding's value and cost, respectively.
Validation:
  Justify: The function should accumulate holding values and costs into the summary.
  Importance: It verifies the function's capability to correctly aggregate multiple holdings' values.

Scenario 3: Adding a holding with zero values doesn't change the holding summary

Details:
  TestName: TestAddZeroValueHoldingDoesNotChangeSummary
  Description: This test ensures that adding a holding with zero value and cost does not alter the holding summary's values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a predefined non-empty HoldingSummary and a zero-valued Holding.
  Act: Use addHoldingToHoldingSummary with the provided Holding and HoldingSummary.
  Assert: Ensure the HoldingSummary remains unchanged after the operation using assert.Equal.
Validation:
  Justify: Adding a holding with zero value and cost logically should not affect the cumulative summary.
  Importance: This test checks that the function correctly handles edge cases with no net changes to asset values.

Scenario 4: Error handling when invalid currency rates are used

Details:
  TestName: TestAddHoldingWithInvalidCurrencyRate
  Description: This test examines the addHoldingToHoldingSummary function's error handling when provided with invalid currency rates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a HoldingSummary and a Holding with valid values, but pass an invalid or nil currency.CurrencyRateByUse to the function.
  Act: Call addHoldingToHoldingSummary with these parameters.
  Assert: Expect the function to return an error or unmodified HoldingSummary using assert.Error or assert.Equal.
Validation:
  Justify: Providing invalid currency data should be handled gracefully, either by ignoring the operation or by signaling an error.
  Importance: Ensures robust error handling and data integrity when currency-related problems occur.

Additional scenarios may encompass handling of concurrent calls to the function (if the function must be thread-safe), complex scenarios with multiple currency rate conversions, and more detailed behavior with regard to `HoldingChange` fields. However, without full visibility into the function's definition or the related types and business rules, these scenarios are speculative and should be adjusted once more information is available.
```

Each of these scenarios focuses on a different aspect of the function's operation and collectively provides a comprehensive test suite for `addHoldingToHoldingSummary`.

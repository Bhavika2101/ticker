ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=addHoldingToHoldingSummary_906dbd0500

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation
Issue: Potential floating-point arithmetic issues may result from the direct manipulation of financial values, leading to inaccurate calculations and potential financial discrepancies.
Solution: Use fixed-point arithmetic or a decimal package like shopspring/decimal to handle monetary values for increased precision and to prevent rounding errors.

================================================================================
Here are several test scenarios for the `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` function in Go testing methodologies, including regular operation, edge cases, and error handling.

---

**Scenario 1: Basic Addition of Non-Zero Holdings**

Details:
  TestName: TestAddNonZeroHolding
  Description: This test examines the `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` function to verify that it correctly adds a holding with non-zero value and cost to the holding summary.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Define an initial `HoldingSummary` object with pre-populated values.
    - Define a `c.Holding` object with non-zero value and cost.
    - Define a `currency.CurrencyRateByUse` object to be used in the calculation.
  Act: Invoke addHoldingToHoldingSummary with the prepared objects.
  Assert: Use `reflect.DeepEqual()` to compare the returned `HoldingSummary` with an expected `HoldingSummary` object that has its fields calculated correctly.
Validation:
  Justify: Asserting using `reflect.DeepEqual()` allows us to verify that the returned struct is exactly as we expect in terms of values and structure.
  Importance: This is significant as it tests the core functionality of the function to ensure assets are accurately aggregated under normal conditions.

---

**Scenario 2: Handling of Zero-Cost Holding**

Details:
  TestName: TestZeroCostHolding
  Description: This test verifies that `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` returns the unchanged `HoldingSummary` when the `c.Holding` has a zero cost.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Define an initial `HoldingSummary` and a `c.Holding` object with zero cost.
    - Define a `currency.CurrencyRateByUse` object to be used in the calculation.
  Act: Invoke addHoldingToHoldingSummary with the prepared objects.
  Assert: Use `assert.Equal()` to check if the returned `HoldingSummary` is equal to the initial `HoldingSummary`.
Validation:
  Justify: The function is expected to return the original `HoldingSummary` when holding cost is zero, which means that such holdings should not affect the summary.
  Importance: Testing this behavior is key to ensuring that the function correctly handles cases where holdings may not have a cost.

---

**Scenario 3: Division by zero when Cost in Summary is Zero**

Details:
  TestName: TestDivisionByZeroInSummary
  Description: This test checks that the `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` function handles division correctly when the initial `HoldingSummary` cost is zero while the added holding has non-zero values.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Create a `HoldingSummary` with zero cost and a positive value.
    - Create a `c.Holding` with positive cost and value.
    - Define a `currency.CurrencyRateByUse`.
  Act: Invoke addHoldingToHoldingSummary and expect a panic or an error due to division by zero.
  Assert: Use `recover()` from a deferred function to catch a runtime panic if any, and assert that panic occurred.
Validation:
  Justify: Detecting a possible division by zero is critical to ensure the application's stability and reliability.
  Importance: Testing for panics due to division by zero is essential to prevent unexpected crashes during runtime.

---

**Scenario 4: Correct Calculation with Different Currency Rates**

Details:
  TestName: TestCalculationWithCurrencyRates
  Description: This scenario ensures that different `currency.CurrencyRateByUse` values are applied correctly during the aggregation to the `HoldingSummary`.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Define a `HoldingSummary` object.
    - Define a `c.Holding` object with valid values.
    - Define different `currency.CurrencyRateByUse` objects with varying rates to test multiple scenarios.
  Act: Invoke `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` with each set of currency rates.
  Assert: Use assertions to verify the correct application of currency rates, comparing the returned `HoldingSummary` against expected results.
Validation:
  Justify: Currency rate conversion is a common operation, so it's vital to ensure that it does not introduce calculation errors.
  Importance: Validating currency rate conversions is crucial for financial applications that deal with multiple currencies.

---

**Scenario 5: Adding Negative Holding Values**

Details:
  TestName: TestNegativeHoldingValues
  Description: This scenario checks that the function correctly handles cases when holdings have negative values or costs, representing debt or short positions.
Execution:
  Arrange:
    - Instantiate a default `HoldingSummary`.
    - Create a `c.Holding` with negative values for `Cost` and `Value`.
    - Provide a `currency.CurrencyRateByUse`.
  Act: Call `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` with the negative holding.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned `HoldingSummary` reflects the deduction of values correctly.
Validation:
  Justify: Ensuring correct handling of negative values is essential for accuracy in representing diverse financial positions.
  Importance: It is important because financial summaries must accurately capture the impact of debt and other negative financial instruments.

---

These test scenarios are structured to align with standard Go testing practices, considering the package's constructs and the function's responsibilities. They help ensure that the `addHoldingToHoldingSummary` function operates correctly in various circumstances and handles edge cases effectively.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: The function `convertAssetQuotePriceCurrency` in 'currency.go' multiplies various QuotePrice fields with a conversion rate without checking for potential overflows, which may result in incorrect conversions and lead to financial inaccuracies.
Solution: Implement a check to ensure that the result of the multiplication does not exceed the maximum value of the data type. If using 'float64', consider checking against 'math.MaxFloat64'. Handle any potential overflow errors gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function doesn't handle exceptional conditions, such as when currencyRateByUse.QuotePrice is zero or negative, which could cause division by zero errors or negative pricing.
Solution: Validate the 'currencyRateByUse.QuotePrice' to ensure it's positive and non-zero before performing currency conversion. Consider returning an error if the value is not within expected bounds.

Vulnerability: CWE-1167: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: Direct multiplication of floating-point numbers without considering precision can introduce rounding errors, especially with monetary values that require exact precision.
Solution: Use a fixed-point arithmetic library or represent monetary values in the smallest unit (e.g., cents) as integers to avoid floating-point precision issues.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Successful conversion of asset quote price currency

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertAssetQuotePriceCurrencySuccess
  Description: This test examines the `convertAssetQuotePriceCurrency` function, verifying that it successfully converts the asset's quote price from one currency to another using the provided conversion rates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `currency.CurrencyRateByUse` instance with a defined quote price conversion rate. Also, prepare an `c.QuotePrice` instance with known values.
  Act: Invoke `convertAssetQuotePriceCurrency` with the mock conversion rate and asset quote price.
  Assert: Use the `reflect.DeepEqual` function in Go to compare the returned `c.QuotePrice` instance to an expected `c.QuotePrice` instance with manually calculated fields to ensure accurate conversion.
Validation:
  Justify: `reflect.DeepEqual` ensures that all fields in the returned structure match the expected structure accounting for the conversion rates applied, which confirms the functionality.
  Importance: Ensuring accurate currency conversion is crucial for displaying correct financial data to users, especially in applications dealing with international markets.

Scenario 2: Testing with zero conversion rate

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertAssetQuotePriceCurrencyWithZeroRate
  Description: This test checks how `convertAssetQuotePriceCurrency` behaves when the conversion rate is zero, simulating a scenario where the currency data might not be available or is set to an invalid rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `currency.CurrencyRateByUse` instance with a quote price conversion rate of zero and a `c.QuotePrice` instance with set values.
  Act: Call `convertAssetQuotePriceCurrency` with these parameters.
  Assert: Assert that all price-related fields in the resulting `c.QuotePrice` are zero while non-price fields remain unchanged, using Go's `testing` package for equality assertions.
Validation:
  Justify: When the conversion rate is zero, the operation should result in zero-valued price fields, representing an absence of value due to conversion.
  Importance: It's important to handle edge cases like a zero conversion rate as it can have significant impact on the financial calculations and displayed data.

Scenario 3: Conversion rate not affecting the percentage change

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertAssetQuotePriceCurrencyChangePercentUnaffected
  Description: This test verifies that the percentage change field of `c.QuotePrice` is not modified by currency conversion as this is a relative value not subject to absolute currency amounts.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a `currency.CurrencyRateByUse` with a non-zero conversion rate and a `c.QuotePrice` with a predefined change percentage.
  Act: Execute `convertAssetQuotePriceCurrency` with the prepared instances.
  Assert: Confirm that the `ChangePercent` value is equal to the original `c.QuotePrice` `ChangePercent` value and has not been altered through conversion.
Validation:
  Justify: The change percentage is relative and should remain constant regardless of currency conversion; thus, it should not be affected by the conversion rate.
  Importance: This test ensures that relative performance metrics are not erroneously altered during currency conversions, maintaining the integrity of financial reporting.

(Additional test scenarios would consider other edge cases like extremely high or low conversion rates, possible rounding errors, and handling of any exceptions or unusual data types that the function may encounter.)

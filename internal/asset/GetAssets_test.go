================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: hardcoded-credentials
Issue: Hardcoded secrets can be accidentally exposed or easily accessed by unauthorized users, which poses a significant security risk.
Solution: Implement a secret management solution to inject credentials at runtime or utilize environment variables.

Vulnerability: unvalidated-input
Issue: Input provided to the application is not validated, which can lead to security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection or buffer overflows.
Solution: Sanitize and validate all incoming data, use prepared statements for database queries, explicitly check command line arguments, and employ proper error handling.

Vulnerability: dependency-vulnerabilities
Issue: Outdated or vulnerable dependencies can introduce security risks. Imported packages not continuously maintained can contain exploitable vulnerabilities.
Solution: Regularly update dependencies to their latest versions, remove unused dependencies, and scan regularly using tools like 'go list -m all | nancy' or 'GoSec'.

Vulnerability: logging-sensitive-information
Issue: Sensitive information might be logged, which could lead to information leakage if logs are not appropriately protected.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information, and if necessary, ensure logs are encrypted and adequately protected, and have restricted access.

================================================================================
Based on the content of the `asset.go` file, let's craft meaningful test scenarios for the `GetAssets` function. Here are some scenarios:

Scenario 1: ValidAssetGroupWithMultipleAssets
Details:
  TestName: TestGetAssetsWithValidInput
  Description: This test validates the behavior of GetAssets when provided with a valid asset group containing multiple assets. It verifies that GetAssets returns the correct slice of assets and the correct holding summary for the given input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock `Context` with necessary currency rates, and a `AssetGroupQuote` with a set of asset quotes and corresponding holdings.
  Act: Call `GetAssets` with the mocked context and asset group quote.
  Assert: Use `reflect.DeepEqual` to check if the returned slice of assets and holding summary match the expected results.
Validation:
  Justify: Deep equality check is necessary to ensure that all fields in the complex structures are correctly populated.
  Importance: Ensures the function handles multiple assets correctly and calculates the holding summary accurately.

Scenario 2: EmptyAssetGroup
Details:
  TestName: TestGetAssetsWithEmptyAssetGroup
  Description: This test examines the behavior of GetAssets when provided with an empty asset group. The function should handle the empty asset group gracefully, returning an empty asset slice and a zero-value holding summary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock `Context` and an empty `AssetGroupQuote`.
  Act: Invoke `GetAssets` with the mocked context and empty asset group quote.
  Assert: Use the `len` function to check that the returned asset slice is empty, and `reflect.DeepEqual` to check that the returned holding summary has zero values.
Validation:
  Justify: The function should function correctly without any assets to process, returning empty results.
  Importance: Validates that the application does not fail or misbehave when no assets are available.

Scenario 3: NilArguments
Details:
  TestName: TestGetAssetsWithNilArguments
  Description: This test ensures that GetAssets returns the expected error when called with `nil` arguments since the function should not allow such input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide `nil` values for both `Context` and `AssetGroupQuote`.
  Act: Call `GetAssets` with `nil` arguments.
  Assert: Check if an appropriate error is returned.
Validation:
  Justify: While the function's signature does not explicitly indicate error return, in practice, such input might indicate a bug elsewhere in the application and should thus be caught.
  Importance: Ensures robust error handling and aids in diagnosing upstream issues.

Scenario 4: AssetWithNoHolding
Details:
  TestName: TestGetAssetsWithAssetHavingNoHolding
  Description: Test the behavior of GetAssets for an asset that does not have a corresponding holding. The asset should be returned with a zero-value holding structure.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `Context` with currency rates and an `AssetGroupQuote` with an asset quote that has no corresponding holding.
  Act: Call `GetAssets`.
  Assert: Use `reflect.DeepEqual` to ensure the asset is returned with a zero holding.
Validation:
  Justify: Validating assets without holdings is important for accurate representation in the portfolio.
  Importance: Ensures that the asset data is presented correctly, regardless of whether holdings exist or not.

Each of these scenarios aims to probe different aspects of the `GetAssets` function to ensure its robustness and correctness in various situations. The assertions are chosen to best capture the conditions being tested, whether it be the content of data structures or the handling of error situations. The importance of each test relates to a facet of the program's expected functionality and business logic.

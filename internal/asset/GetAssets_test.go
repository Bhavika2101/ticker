ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=GetAssets_24d8ee5bf0

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The code might create files with insecure default permissions, which could allow unauthorized users to read, modify, or delete these files.
Solution: Use '0600' permissions when creating files to ensure that only the owner has read and write access, and apply umask as needed.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: If any of the serialized data structures are coming from an untrusted source, deserializing them without validation can lead to remote code execution or other attacks.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all input data when deserializing, and consider using safe serialization libraries that do not allow code execution.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: The use of integers in loops or arithmetic operations can lead to overflows if not checked, especially if the integers are influenced by external input.
Solution: Use 'math/big' for large integers and always check for overflows/underflows in arithmetic operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: Any use of raw SQL queries that incorporate untrusted input can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by database/sql to safely handle SQL queries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: GetAssets with a valid asset group quote

Details:
  TestName: TestGetAssets_ValidAssetGroupQuote
  Description: Test GetAssets function to ensure it returns the correct assets and holding summary when provided with a valid asset group quote.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a `Context` with necessary information, such as currency rates. Construct a valid `AssetGroupQuote` with test data including asset quotes and holdings.
  Act: Invoke the `GetAssets` function with the arranged context and asset group quote.
  Assert: Check if the list of `Asset` and `HoldingSummary` returned by the function matches the expected data set up in the Arrange step, using `reflect.DeepEqual` for deep equality checks. Expect no errors.
Validation:
  Justify: Deep equality check is important to ensure all fields of complex structures match with expected results.
  Importance: Ensuring GetAssets correctly computes the asset details and holding summary is essential for accurate financial reporting and user portfolio display.

---

Scenario 2: GetAssets with an empty holdings list

Details:
  TestName: TestGetAssets_EmptyHoldingsList
  Description: Examines how GetAssets processes a situation where the asset group has no holdings, simulating a new user without assets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a `Context` and an `AssetGroupQuote` with no holdings (empty holdings list).
  Act: Call the `GetAssets` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns a slice of `Asset` with length 0 and a `HoldingSummary` with zero values using `testing.TB` methods like `if len(assets) != 0 { t.Errorf(...) }`.
Validation:
  Justify: It's crucial to test this scenario to ensure the system can handle users with no assets.
  Importance: This situation must be handled gracefully to avoid panics or errors that could affect new or existing users exploring the app without any holdings.

---

Scenario 3: GetAssets with a non-existent currency code in holdings

Details:
  TestName: TestGetAssets_InvalidCurrencyCode
  Description: Checks how GetAssets behaves when provided with a holdings list that contains a non-existent currency code.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a `Context` and an `AssetGroupQuote` with a currency code that is not recognized by the system in one of the holdings.
  Act: Invoke the `GetAssets` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Make sure that the function handles the error gracefully, potentially returning a default currency rate or an identifiable error, by using `if !ok { t.Fatal(...) }`.
Validation:
  Justify: Testing how the system handles invalid data is important for maintaining robustness and error handling.
  Importance: Ensures that input errors don't lead to unexpected behavior or crashes that can degrade the user experience and trust in the system.

---

Please note that without specific struct details, error messages, and function internals, I have made assumptions based on the seen portion of the code and standard practices. If more function details and behavior are needed, I will need to inspect the entire `asset.go` file to provide more accurate scenarios.

ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getLots_a921841eb1

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function 'getLots' checks if the input array 'lots' is nil but does not check for an empty slice, which could lead to unexpected behavior if called with an empty but non-nil slice.
Solution: Add a length check for the 'lots' slice to handle both nil and empty slice cases. That is, change the condition to 'if lots == nil || len(lots) == 0 { ... }'

================================================================================
It seems that we have a partial content of the `getLots` function definition which accepts one parameter, a slice of lots of type `[]c.Lot`, and returns a map of `string` to `AggregatedLot` structs. It also has a condition that checks if the input `lots` is `nil`, in which case it returns an empty map.

Given the partial content provided, I will create test scenarios based on this function's signature and the observed behavior from the partial content. Since test scenarios are required to be very detailed, we need complete information about the function to craft comprehensive test cases. I will proceed with the available information and make assumptions where necessary.

Test scenarios for the `getLots` function:

```
Scenario 1: Empty Lots Slice Returns Empty Map

Details:
  TestName: TestGetLotsWithEmptyInput
  Description: This test verifies that the getLots function correctly returns an empty map when provided with a nil slice of lots.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a nil slice of c.Lot.
  Act: Invoke getLots with the created nil slice.
  Assert: Check whether the returned map is empty by comparing it to an expected empty map of string to AggregatedLot using reflect.DeepEqual.
Validation:
  Justify: According to the given implementation detail, when lots are nil, getLots should return an empty map. This behavior should conform to error handling principles where invalid input results in benign output.
  Importance: Ensuring that the function handles nil input gracefully prevents potential nil pointer dereferences, improving the robustness of the code.

Scenario 2: Single Lot Aggregation

Details:
  TestName: TestGetLotsWithSingleLot
  Description: The test will check if getLots can correctly aggregate a single lot into the returned map.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with a single Lot item, specifying its properties.
  Act: Call getLots with the arranged slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned map has a single key-value pair that matches the aggregate data of the single lot.
Validation:
  Justify: This scenario is the base case of aggregation and ensures that simple input results in correct and expected aggregation.
  Importance: Essential for validating the basic functionality of lot aggregation, which is a core feature of the getLots function.

Scenario 3: Multiple Lots Aggregation

Details:
  TestName: TestGetLotsWithMultipleLots
  Description: This test will examine how getLots aggregates multiple lots, ensuring it correctly sums costs and quantities.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with multiple Lot items, including some with the same symbol.
  Act: Call getLots with the arranged slice.
  Assert: Assert that the returned map correctly represents the aggregated data for each symbol, summing costs and quantities appropriately.
Validation:
  Justify: The getLots function is expected to aggregate lots by symbol, and this scenario tests the key functionality of the aggregation process.
  Importance: It's crucial for ensuring that the aggregation logic is correctly implemented, which is a central aspect of the asset tracking system.

Scenario 4: Error Handling for Invalid Lots Data

Details:
  TestName: TestGetLotsWithInvalidData
  Description: The test ensures that the getLots function handles invalid data within Lots without causing a runtime error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice with invalid data (e.g., negative numbers or incorrect types if allowed by the compiler).
  Act: Call getLots with this slice.
  Assert: Check that the function does not panic and returns a map with the best effort aggregation, or appropriately handles the data based on the specifications.
Validation:
  Justify: The function should be resilient to incorrect data and either handle it gracefully or notify the caller through documented behavior.
  Importance: Important for the overall error handling strategy of the application to prevent crashes and undefined behavior.

Please note that complete code for `getLots` and specifications of `c.Lot` and `AggregatedLot` are not provided, and the details of individual Lot items and their properties are not known. The scenarios assume that `c.Lot` contains at least a symbol, cost, and quantity, which are standard properties for such entities.
```

To generate more accurate test scenarios, please provide the complete `getLots` function and any related structs or types (`c.Lot`, `AggregatedLot`) that it uses.

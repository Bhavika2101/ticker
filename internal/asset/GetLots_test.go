================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: import-use-of-external-package
Issue: The use of an external package 'github.com/achannarasappa/ticker/internal/common' can pose risks if the package is not properly vetted or kept up to date, potentially making the application susceptible to known vulnerabilities within these dependencies.
Solution: Ensure that all external packages are regularly reviewed for security updates and vulnerabilities. Utilize tools such as 'go mod tidy' to keep dependencies tidy and 'go list -m all | xargs go get -u' to update external packages.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Aggregating multiple lots for a single symbol

Details:
  TestName: TestAggregateSingleSymbol
  Description: This test examines the `getLots` function's ability to aggregate multiple lots for a single symbol into a single `AggregatedLot` instance and ensure that the quantities and costs are correctly summarized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of `c.Lot` instances with different quantities and costs, all sharing the same symbol.
  Act: Invoke `getLots` function with the created slice of lots.
  Assert: Use Go's `reflect.DeepEqual` to compare the returned map with an expected map that contains a single `AggregatedLot` entry with the aggregated quantities and costs.
Validation:
  Justify: This assertion checks that the aggregation logic correctly aggregates lots by symbol, summing quantities and costs.
  Importance: The aggregation of lots into `AggregatedLot` instances is critical to accurately represent portfolio positions. This test ensures the function can handle typical asset groupings.

Scenario 2: Handling nil input slice

Details:
  TestName: TestGetLotsWithNilSlice
  Description: This test examines the `getLots` function's handling of a `nil` slice, expecting it to return an empty map without error.
Execution:
  Arrange: Pass a `nil` slice to the function.
  Act: Invoke `getLots` function with a `nil` value.
  Assert: Check if the returned map is empty and not `nil` itself using `len` function to ensure it has zero entries.
Validation:
  Justify: The assertion validates the function's robustness to inputs that may occur during irregular operations or exceptional cases.
  Importance: Ensuring that the function gracefully handles `nil` inputs prevents potential runtime panics, which would otherwise destabilize the application.

Scenario 3: Aggregating multiple lots for different symbols

Details:
  TestName: TestAggregateMultipleSymbols
  Description: This test looks at the `getLots` function's ability to correctly aggregate multiple lots for different symbols into their respective `AggregatedLot` entries.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of `c.Lot` instances for multiple symbols, each with varying quantities and costs.
  Act: Invoke `getLots` function with the slice.
  Assert: Use `reflect.DeepEqual` to ensure the map returned matches an expected map with separate `AggregatedLot` entries for each symbol.
Validation:
  Justify: By asserting the equality of complex maps, we ensure that lots for different symbols are not mixed and are independently aggregated.
  Importance: The correct aggregation of assets across multiple symbols is essential to provide a clear view of the holdings in a portfolio, which is a fundamental requirement for financial applications.

We would implement these scenarios in a Go test file, using Go's standard testing package along with any necessary test fixtures or helpers. Mocks may also be used if we need to isolate the function further or if it interacts with external dependencies, but based on the current information about `getLots`, it seems to work solely with the input data provided.

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The function `getLots` does not check for negative quantities or unit costs which could result in incorrect cost calculations and potentially manipulated asset valuations.
Solution: Implement validation checks for the 'lot.Quantity' and 'lot.UnitCost' to ensure that they are greater than zero before processing the calculations.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Implicit conversions between numeric types could lead to precision loss when multiplying 'lot.UnitCost' with 'lot.Quantity'.
Solution: Ensure that all numeric computations are performed with deliberate type conversions and adequate precision, especially when dealing with financial values.

Vulnerability: CWE-570: Expression is Always False
Issue: The check `lots == nil` is always false because slices are nil only if they are uninitialized; however, when they have zero elements, they are non-nil with length zero.
Solution: Replace the nil-check with `len(lots) == 0` to correctly handle empty slices.

Vulnerability: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
Issue: The function `getLots` writes to a shared map 'aggregatedLots' without proper synchronization which could lead to a race condition if called concurrently.
Solution: Use mutexes or other synchronization primitives to protect the writes to 'aggregatedLots' when `getLots` is expected to be used in a concurrent environment.

================================================================================
Based on the code extracted from the `asset.go` file, let's proceed with crafting the test scenarios for the `getLots` function. 

`getLots` is a function that takes a slice of `c.Lot` and returns a map of `AggregatedLot` by symbol. This function aggregates lots by their symbol, adding up the quantities and costs, and tracks the index order of the lots.

```go
func getLots(lots []c.Lot) map[string]AggregatedLot {
    // ... function implementation ...
}
```

Here are the testing scenarios using the standard Go testing methodologies:

Scenario 1: Normal Case - Aggregate multiple lots of the same symbol

Details:
  TestName: TestAggregateMultipleLots
  Description: This test examines the `getLots` function by providing a slice of `c.Lot` where multiple lots have the same symbol. It ensures that the lots are correctly aggregated into an `AggregatedLot` for each symbol.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a slice of `c.Lot` instances with at least two lots having the same symbol.
  Act: Call the `getLots` function with the prepared slice.
  Assert: Use the `reflect.DeepEqual` to compare the expected map of `AggregatedLot` with the actual result from the `getLots` function.
Validation:
  Justify: Since `getLots` should aggregate the properties of lots based on their symbols, checking the sum of quantities and costs is essential for correct aggregation.
  Importance: Ensuring that lots of the same symbol are aggregated correctly is crucial for accurate asset valuation in the application's financial context.

Scenario 2: Edge Case - Empty list of lots

Details:
  TestName: TestEmptyLotsList
  Description: The test evaluates the `getLots` function's behavior when provided an empty slice of lots, ensuring it handles the edge case without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty slice of `c.Lot`.
  Act: Call the `getLots` function with the empty slice.
  Assert: Use `len` to verify that the resulting map is empty.
Validation:
  Justify: An empty input should result in an empty output without triggering any errors. This verifies the function's robustness.
  Importance: This edge case test checks the function's ability to handle scenarios with no data, which may occur in live environments.

Scenario 3: Error Case - Nil slice of lots

Details:
  TestName: TestNilLotsSlice
  Description: This test assesses the `getLots` function when a nil slice is passed as input, ensuring the function can handle nil inputs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a nil slice of `c.Lot`.
  Act: Invoke the `getLots` function with the nil slice.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is a non-nil but empty map.
Validation:
  Justify: Handling nil slices correctly prevents potential nil pointer dereferences, which can cause runtime panics.
  Importance: Robust error handling is critical to prevent crashes when unexpected nil data is encountered.

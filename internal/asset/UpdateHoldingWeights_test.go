ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=updateHoldingWeights_51a09f693e

Based on the extracted content of `asset.go`, it seems that the function `updateHoldingWeights` takes an array of `c.Asset` and a `HoldingSummary` as parameters and returns an updated array of `c.Asset` with recalculated weights. Unfortunately, the rest of the function's implementation has been truncated, but we can assume that it calculates weights based on the asset value and the total value from the `HoldingSummary`.

Given the nature of this function, we can devise several test scenarios which will focus on:

- A typical path where all values are positive and valid.
- A zero total holding value scenario which should cause all weights to be zero or not change (depending on the implementation).
- Negative asset values, which could occur due to market conditions or errors in data.
- Exceptionally large values to test the handling of overflow conditions.
- Edge cases with assets having a zero value.
- Handling of any potential errors such as a nil array of assets.

Now let's structure the test scenarios accordingly:

```
Scenario 1: All weights are correctly recalculated for a typical set of assets with positive values

Details:
  TestName: TestUpdateHoldingWeightsStandardCase
  Description: This test examines the updateHoldingWeights function with a typical input of assets with positive values and a non-zero total holdings value, ensuring proper recalculation of weights.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of `c.Asset` with positive holding values, and a `HoldingSummary` with a positive total value.
  Act: Invoke `updateHoldingWeights` with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Verify that each asset's weight is calculated as `(asset.Holding.Value / holdingSummary.Value) * 100`, and ensure the weights are within a reasonable floating-point precision error range.
Validation:
  Justify: Weights should represent the proportion of each asset's value relative to the total value, hence this mathematical formula for weight is standard for portfolio management systems.
  Importance: This test ensures that under normal operating circumstances, the application correctly apportions asset weighting, which is essential for investment portfolio analysis.

Scenario 2: Handling zero total value in holding summary

Details:
  TestName: TestUpdateHoldingWeightsZeroTotalValue
  Description: This test examines the updateHoldingWeights function when the total holdings value is zero, which may indicate an empty portfolio or a market down situation. The expected behavior is that all weights remain zero or not changed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of `c.Asset` with holding values and a `HoldingSummary` with a total value of zero.
  Act: Invoke `updateHoldingWeights` with the arranged parameters.
  Assert: Check if all asset weights are set to zero or have not changed from their initial values.
Validation:
  Justify: In the absence of any total value, individual asset weights should logically equate to zero or not change, as they cannot hold any proportional value.
  Importance: This test protects against divide-by-zero errors and ensures the application gracefully handles situations where total asset value is nullified.

Scenario 3: Validation of weights with negative asset values

Details:
  TestName: TestUpdateHoldingWeightsNegativeAssetValues
  Description: This test assesses the updateHoldingWeights function in the case where asset values are negative, which can occur due to data entry errors or specific market conditions causing the investment to lose more than its initial value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of `c.Asset` with some negative holding values, and a `HoldingSummary` with a positive total value.
  Act: Invoke `updateHoldingWeights` with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure that the function does not produce any calculation errors and that negative weights are handled as per the specification (which may need to define expected behavior in such cases).
Validation:
  Justify: Negative asset values indicate a decrease in investment value, potentially leading to negative weights, which need to be either handled or rejected based on business rules.
  Importance: This test scenario ensures robustness in dealing with erroneous or unexpected input and the accurate representation of investment status.

Scenario 4: Handling exceptionally large asset values for stress testing overflow prevention

Details:
  TestName: TestUpdateHoldingWeightsLargeValues
  Description: This test is designed to stress the updateHoldingWeights function with exceptionally large asset and total values to test if the function can handle potential overflow issues without loss of precision.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of `c.Asset` with exceedingly large holding values and a `HoldingSummary` with a correspondingly large total value.
  Act: Invoke `updateHoldingWeights` with the arranged data.
  Assert: Confirm that the calculated weights are correctly computed and no overflow/underflow has occurred.
Validation:
  Justify: Ensuring that weight calculations are accurate even with very large values is critical for application stability and precision.
  Importance: This test ensures the system is resilient against overflow conditions which could lead to inaccurate representations of an asset's portfolio weight, potentially affecting investment decisions.

Scenario 5: Verifying handling of assets with zero value

Details:
  TestName: TestUpdateHoldingWeightsZeroValuedAssets
  Description: This test ensures that the updateHoldingWeights function can accurately handle assets that have a zero value without affecting the weights calculation of other assets.
Execution:
  Arrange: Produce an array of `c.Asset` where some have a zero value and others have positive values, and a valid `HoldingSummary`.
  Act: Invoke `updateHoldingWeights` with these parameters.
  Assert:
  - Assets with a zero value should either retain a zero weight or as per any specified business rules.
  - Other assets should have their weights calculated correctly without influence from the zero-valued assets.
Validation:
  Justify: Assets with a zero value should not contribute to the total weight distribution of the portfolio.
  Importance: This scenario confirms the accuracy of weight calculation in a mixed-asset situation and is critical for maintaining reliability in portfolio analyses.
```

These test scenarios cover the core aspects of testing the `updateHoldingWeights` function, from regular operation to various edge cases and potential error handling.

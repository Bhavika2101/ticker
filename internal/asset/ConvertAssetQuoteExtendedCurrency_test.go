ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency_e3d649d65f

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function 'convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency' does not perform input validation on the 'currencyRateByUse' parameter which may lead to incorrect currency conversion if unexpected data is passed.
Solution: Implement input validation on 'currencyRateByUse' to ensure it contains valid 'QuotePrice' values. This should include checking for positive values, as currency rates cannot be negative or zero.

Vulnerability: Data Integrity
Issue: There is no check to ensure 'currencyRateByUse.QuotePrice' is not zero, which could result in a division by zero error or lead to invalid financial data due to multiplication with zero.
Solution: Add a check to prevent 'currencyRateByUse.QuotePrice' from being zero before performing calculations. If it is zero, handle the error appropriately or skip the operation.

Vulnerability: Precision Loss
Issue: Multiplications with currency rates may introduce floating point precision issues, which are critical in financial applications.
Solution: Use fixed-point arithmetic or a decimal package that can handle currency appropriately to avoid precision loss during multiplication.

Vulnerability: Lack of Error Handling
Issue: The function does not return any errors, which means it silently fails when unexpected issues occur, potentially leading to further data inconsistencies.
Solution: Change the function's signature to return an error as well and handle any error that arises throughout the currency conversion process, passing it back to the caller.

================================================================================
Based on the provided file content, let's create test scenarios for the function `convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency`. 

---

Scenario 1: Successful conversion of an asset quote with a positive exchange rate

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrencyPositiveRate
  Description: This test verifies that the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency function correctly converts all price-related fields of a QuoteExtended struct when provided with a positive currency exchange rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock CurrencyRateByUse with a positive QuotePrice exchange rate and a mock QuoteExtended with some predefined prices.
  Act: Invoke convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency with the mocks as parameters.
  Assert: Compare each field of the returned QuoteExtended struct with the expected value, which is the original value multiplied by the exchange rate.
Validation:
  Justify: Correct functionality means each price field should reflect the conversion accurately, without modification of unchanged fields.
  Importance: Ensures that positive currency exchange rates are being handled correctly, which is a common and critical operation in financial applications.

Scenario 2: Handling of zero exchange rate

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrencyZeroRate
  Description: This test ensures that the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency function behaves as expected when a zero currency exchange rate is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock CurrencyRateByUse with a zero QuotePrice exchange rate and a mock QuoteExtended struct.
  Act: Invoke convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency with the mocks.
  Assert: Ensure that all price-related fields of the returned QuoteExtended struct are zero since multiplying by zero should nullify the values.
Validation:
  Justify: A zero exchange rate should universally yield zero price fields, reflecting a correct but edge-case behavior of the system.
  Importance: This test prevents divisions by zero, nonsensical outputs, and possibly undefined behavior in any downstream processing of quote data.

Scenario 3: Negative exchange rate conversion

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrencyNegativeRate
  Description: This test is focused on checking how the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency function handles negative currency exchange rates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a mock CurrencyRateByUse with a negative QuotePrice exchange rate and a mock QuoteExtended struct with positive prices.
  Act: Call convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency with these mocks.
  Assert: Check that all the price-related fields in the returned QuoteExtended struct are negative, following the input rate's sign.
Validation:
  Justify: The intent is to verify the function's response to a potentially unexpected but technically valid case of negative rates.
  Importance: While negative rates are atypical in currency exchange, ensuring correct behavior under such conditions is crucial for financial robustness.

Scenario 4: Input validation for null QuoteExtended values

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrencyNullInput
  Description: This scenario tests the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency function's response to nil or empty QuoteExtended input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock CurrencyRateByUse with a valid exchange rate and a nil QuoteExtended.
  Act: Try invoking convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency with a nil QuoteExtended.
  Assert: Expect an error to be returned or valid handling that would prevent a runtime panic.
Validation:
  Justify: The function should handle or report invalid inputs gracefully without causing the application to crash.
  Importance: Input validation is a critical safety net, preventing runtime errors when unexpected input is encountered.

---

These scenarios outline a range of expected, edge case, and error conditions that should be tested to ensure the `convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency` function is robust and handles various inputs correctly. As we don't have the full visibility of the function's implementation and its intended behavior, the assertions and justifications are based on usual practices for such data transformation functions in financial applications.

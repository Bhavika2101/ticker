================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: Possible incorrect conversion between numeric types when multiplying currency rates by price values. If either value is large enough, it may cause an overflow or precision loss.
Solution: Ensure proper handling of numeric conversion and consider bounds checking or using types with wider ranges if applicable.

Vulnerability: CWE-369: Divide By Zero
Issue: Potential divide by zero in operations with currencyRateByUse.QuotePrice if its value is zero, resulting in a runtime panic.
Solution: Include validation to make sure currencyRateByUse.QuotePrice is not zero before performing operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound
Issue: Integer overflow may occur if multiplied values exceed the max int size without proper checking.
Solution: Perform overflow checks or use big.Int/big.Float for large number operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions
Issue: Lack of checks for unusual or exceptional conditions that may arise from the input data or during arithmetic operations.
Solution: Introduce thorough input validation and preemptive error handling to manage exceptional cases in data and arithmetic operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-789: Uncontrolled Memory Consumption
Issue: A loop or recursion without the proper termination condition might lead to uncontrolled memory consumption.
Solution: Audit the code for potential infinite loops or recursive calls and implement safeguards against unbounded growth.

================================================================================
The `convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency` function in the `asset` package has the following signature:

```go
func convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency(currencyRateByUse currency.CurrencyRateByUse, quoteExtended c.QuoteExtended) c.QuoteExtended
```

Based on this signature, I can deduce that the function takes two parameters: `currencyRateByUse` which is of type `currency.CurrencyRateByUse`, and `quoteExtended` which is of type `c.QuoteExtended` (with `c` being an alias for the `github.com/achannarasappa/ticker/internal/common` package). The function returns a value of type `c.QuoteExtended`.

Now, I will proceed to write test scenarios taking into account:
- The parameters the function accepts
- The data types involved
- The expected behavior of the function

Test scenarios will cover regular operation, edge cases, and error handling by structuring each test case following the provided format.

Scenario 1: Regular Conversion of Extended Quote Currency

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency
  Description: This test examines the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency function to ensure it correctly converts all monetary values in a QuoteExtended struct to a new currency using a CurrencyRateByUse struct for the exchange rate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a CurrencyRateByUse instance with a specific exchange rate and a QuoteExtended struct with known values.
  Act: Invoke the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency with the prepared instances.
  Assert: Assert that each monetary value in the returned QuoteExtended struct is equal to the initial value multiplied by the exchange rate.
Validation:
  Justify: As the function is responsible for monetary conversion, it is crucial that each value is converted accurately. The assertion validates that the function performs as expected under normal circumstances.
  Importance: Correct currency conversion is essential for accurate financial reporting and user trust. It is one of the core functionalities of this application when dealing with international assets.

Scenario 2: Edge Case with Zero Exchange Rate

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertWithZeroExchangeRate
  Description: The test checks the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency function when the exchange rate is zero, ensuring that the function appropriately handles this edge case without resulting in unexpected behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a CurrencyRateByUse with a zero exchange rate and a regular QuoteExtended struct.
  Act: Call the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency function with these parameters.
  Assert: Assert that all monetary values in the returned QuoteExtended struct are zero.
Validation:
  Justify: Testing with an edge case of a zero exchange rate is important to confirm that no division by zero errors occur and that the monetary values don't propagate in an uncontrolled manner.
  Importance: This test ensures robust error handling, which contributes to the overall resilience and stability of the financial application.

Scenario 3: Error Handling with Invalid Input Types

Details:
  TestName: TestConvertWithInvalidInputTypes
  Description: This scenario ensures that the convertAssetQuoteExtendedCurrency function can handle invalid inputs gracefully without causing runtime errors or panics.
Execution:
  Arrange: Attempt to call the function with types that do not conform to the expected parameters (e.g., passing a string or an invalid struct instead).
  Act: Expect the Go runtime to reject the call at compile time.
  Assert: Since this is a compilation error, the assertion is that the program does not compile when incorrect types are used.
Validation:
  Justify: Ensuring only valid types are passed to the function is essential to maintain type safety, which is a key feature of Go.
  Importance: Type safety prevents a class of bugs that could lead to unpredictable application behavior, potentially causing financial miscalculations.

We would proceed with further scenarios to explore cases such as null values, extremely large numbers, and scenarios with negative exchange rates, among others, following a similar structured approach as above.
